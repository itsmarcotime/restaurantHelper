# Restaurant Helper

Our application is a simple easy to use solution that could help out a wide range of food vendors whether it be a food truck that needs help staying organized with their orders, or small restaurants who donâ€™t want to spend big money on complex software. Our application is simple, easy to use, & FREE. We completed this appliction using MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node). Currently our user login is going through some technical difficulties.
