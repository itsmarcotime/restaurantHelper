## Description
Restaurant Helper is a simple easy to use application that could help out a wide range of food vendors. Whether it be a food truck that needs help staying organized with their orders, or a small restaurant that doesn't want to spend big money on complex software. Our application is simple, easy to use, & FREE. We completed this appliction using MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node). Currently our user login is going through some technical difficulties. 

## Built-with
Restaurant Helper was built using MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS, and Node.JS.
